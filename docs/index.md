# 📚 The Realtime AI Backend: Master Index

Welcome! This isn't just a project; it's a **Masterclass in Modern AI Engineering**. If you've been "vibe coding" (relying on AI to do everything without understanding why), this is where that ends. 

Each document below is a building block. Read them in order to understand not just *how* to write the code, but the *architecture* and *science* behind it.
