# 📚 The Realtime AI Backend: Master Index

Welcome! This isn't just a project; it's a **Masterclass in Modern AI Engineering**. If you've been "vibe coding" (relying on AI to do everything without understanding why), this is where that ends. 

Each document below is a building block. Read them in order to understand not just *how* to write the code, but the *architecture* and *science* behind it.

## 🏁 Phase 0: The Big Picture
- [**00 - Introduction: The Quest**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/00_Introduction.md) - What are we actually building?
- [**01 - Project Blueprint**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/01_Project_Blueprint.md) - The birds-eye view of the system.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: The Tech Stack (Deep Dives)
> [!NOTE]
> Detailed "spoon-feeding" explanations and code deep-dives are now hosted in the [Savvy-Acumen Knowledge Base](https://github.com/pranavsinghpatil/Savvy-Acumen/tree/main/Docs/LLM-Backer).

> [!TIP]
> **Learning Tip**: As you read, don't just look at the code snippets. Look at the **Why** sections. That is where the mastery lies.
