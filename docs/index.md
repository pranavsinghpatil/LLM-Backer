# 📚 The Realtime AI Backend: Master Index

Welcome! This isn't just a project; it's a **Masterclass in Modern AI Engineering**. If you've been "vibe coding" (relying on AI to do everything without understanding why), this is where that ends. 

Each document below is a building block. Read them in order to understand not just *how* to write the code, but the *architecture* and *science* behind it.

## 🏁 Phase 0: The Big Picture
- [**00 - Introduction: The Quest**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/00_Introduction.md) - What are we actually building?
- [**01 - Project Blueprint**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/01_Project_Blueprint.md) - The birds-eye view of the system.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: The Tech Stack (Deep Dives)
- [**02 - FastAPI: The Engine**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/02_FastAPI_The_Engine.md) - Why we use it and how it manages high performance.
- [**03 - WebSockets: Real-time Magic**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/03_WebSockets_Realtime_Magic.md) - How to keep an "open line" between client and server.
- [**04 - LLM Streaming Explained**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/04_LLM_Streaming_Explained.md) - Sending words as they are born, not after they are finished.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Advanced Intelligence
- [**05 - Function Calling: The AI's Hands**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/05_Function_Calling.md) - How the AI can "do" things outside of just talking.
- [**07 - Asynchronous Python Mastery**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/07_Async_Python.md) - The secret to non-blocking code.

## 💾 Phase 3: Data & Automation
- [**06 - Supabase: The Memory**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/06_Supabase_The_Memory.md) - Storing sessions and event logs.
- [**08 - Post-Session Automation**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/08_Automation.md) - What happens when the user hangs up?

## 🛡️ Phase 4: Production Grade
- [**09 - Best Practices**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/09_Best_Practices.md) - Security, config management, and env variables.
- [**10 - The Testing Workflow**](file:///c:/GitRepo/LLM-Backer/docs/10_Testing.md) - How to prove your code works.

> **Learning Tip**: As you read, don't just look at the code snippets. Look at the **Why** sections. That is where the mastery lies.
